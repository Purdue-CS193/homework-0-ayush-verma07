# Ayush's First CS193 Homework

## My Favorite things about CS193 :)
- We learn actual useful information about the terminal that almost every programmer must be well-versed in.
- We learn of interesting CS-related events such as club fairs and opportunities on campus that would be difficult to learn about otherwise.
- We are taught by students who could perhaps teach/explain concepts that would help us understand better as students ourselves.
- We have weekly PSOs where we can ask relevant questions and get help.
- We become better at debugging, a critical skill for all CS courses.
